    <img src="https://www.juniorcoders.ca/assets/img/program3_big_pic.jpg" alt=""width=800>
    <p>Young children are intrigued and excited by technology, and this is an ideal time for them to get involved in the creative process of coding. Our Big Kids after school program creates an immersive, activity-based fun learning environment exposing your child to a wide spectrum of computer concepts.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>PROGRAM GOALS</h2>
    <img src="https://www.juniorcoders.ca/assets/img/slide-1.jpg" alt=""width=800>
    <p>Learning coding helps develop young minds for grasping more advanced concepts later on and opens up avenues for problem solving, creative thinking, innovation, and the skill to design of systems for specific tasks. It also fosters an understanding of the power and limits of human and machine intelligences.</p>
